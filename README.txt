README:

The purpose of this project was to create a compiler for a language with a limited set of features (the syntax and capabilities of the language can be seen by looking in the test folder at any of the .bl programs). The project had three components: parsing input (and verifying the syntax), checking the semantics of the program, and then generating assembly code corresponding to the higher level language. The three classes that I primarily worked on are Parser, SemanticVisitor, and CodeGenVisitor. Most of the rest of the code was provided to us as support code. These classes are in the src folder.

Further documentation for the project can be found in the pdfs in the folder.
